# Hello!ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marvin and am a Front-End Developer.

Re-inspired by [___King Richard___](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKP_0z52ZAw) , a biographical sports film about Venus and Serena Williams, I went from brewing your favorite coffee drinks to creating user experiences with code. This being a childhood dream, I'm happy to be here and part of a community striving to make the world better through technology.
